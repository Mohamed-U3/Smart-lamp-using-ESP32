# Smart Lamp Project with ESP32 C3 mini

## Description: 

The Smart Lamp Software Architecture Document is a comprehensive guide detailing the intricate design and structure of a sophisticated smart lamp system. This intelligent lighting solution is orchestrated through a mobile application, allowing users to seamlessly control various aspects of the lamp, such as light intensity, color, and timing. The communication between the mobile app and the smart lamp is facilitated over a WIFI network, employing the MQTT protocol for efficient and reliable remote-control capabilities.

The project's primary objective is to provide users with an intuitive and immersive lighting experience. By utilizing the MQTT protocol, the smart lamp system ensures both local and global connectivity options, enhancing its adaptability to diverse user needs. In this intricate network, stakeholders play pivotal roles, with end-users interacting through the mobile application, and developers and maintainers ensuring the system's functionality, reliability, and scalability.

The scope of the document extends to the architectural aspects of the smart lamp system, focusing on key components such as global files, GPIO/LEDs control, timers, communication modules, and interfaces. Each section delves into the responsibilities, interactions, and dependencies of these components, offering a comprehensive understanding of the software architecture.

The purpose of this document is to serve as a valuable reference guide for developers, architects, and other stakeholders involved in the project. By documenting the software architecture, it aims to foster a shared understanding of the system's design, thereby facilitating smoother development processes, effective communication among team members, and providing a robust foundation for the maintenance and future enhancements of the smart lamp software. Through this systematic exploration of the architecture, the document aims to contribute to the overall reliability and robustness of the smart lamp system.
